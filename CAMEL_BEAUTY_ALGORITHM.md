# Camel Beauty Rating System

## What It Does

The Camel Beauty Rating System is an AI-powered application that automatically evaluates and scores camel beauty from photographs. Users simply upload a camel image, and the system provides a comprehensive beauty analysis with detailed scoring.

## How It Works

**Step 1: Image Upload & Validation**
- Users upload a camel photograph through the API
- The system validates that the image contains a clearly visible camel
- Checks that key body parts (head, neck, body, legs) are visible for analysis

**Step 2: AI Beauty Analysis**
The system analyzes four main areas of camel beauty:

- **Head Beauty**: Evaluates head size, jaw length, ear shape, snout curve, and facial proportions
- **Neck Beauty**: Assesses neck length, thickness, straightness, and positioning
- **Body Beauty**: Analyzes hump position, body height, shoulder region, and overall proportions  
- **Leg Beauty**: Reviews leg alignment, joint angles, bone thickness, and muscle definition

**Step 3: Intelligent Scoring**
- Each feature receives a score from 1-10 based on traditional camel beauty standards
- Important features (like head size and neck length) are weighted more heavily in the final score
- The system considers the camel's age and gender for appropriate evaluation criteria

**Step 4: Results**
- Provides an overall beauty score (1-10)
- Detailed breakdown by body region
- Individual scores for 20+ specific attributes
- Clear explanations for each rating
